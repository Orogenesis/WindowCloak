A privacy-focused macOS application that selectively hides specific applications from screen sharing sessions while keeping them visible and usable on your local display. All processing happens locally, no data leaves your machine.

Perfect for any screen sharing scenario where you need to:
- Keep reference materials (notes apps, documentation) open but hidden from viewers
- Maintain privacy for specific applications during screen sharing
- Share your full workflow without revealing sensitive information

2. Download the latest version: **WindowCloak-X.X.X-macos.dmg**
3. Open the downloaded DMG file
4. Drag **WindowCloak** to the **Applications** folder

Since the app isn't code-signed by Apple, macOS will quarantine it after download. To unblock it:

Alternatively, open **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security** and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the blocked app message.

   - Enable WindowCloak

2. **Configure Hidden Apps**:

   - Go to Applications tab
   - Click "Add Application"
   - Select apps you want to hide

Configuration is automatically persisted to:
```
~/Library/Application Support/com.windowcloak/configuration.json
```

3. **Start Capture**:
   - Click "Start Capture"
   - The preview window shows your filtered screen
   - When sharing in your video conferencing app, share the "WindowCloak Preview" window, not "Share entire screen"
